/**
 * @typedef {object} Driver What a runtime implements. Only listSessions and items are required; each optional
 *   method that is present turns on the matching capability (caps in runtime.hello).
 * @property {() => Promise<object[]>} listSessions - its sessions as Session rows (session_id, title, cwd, status,
 *   updated_at, rev, last_text, space_*…; docs/protocol/protocol.md "Data types").
 * @property {() => string[] | undefined | Promise<string[] | undefined>} [unlistedTranscripts] - the Claude transcripts
 *   on this computer that are sessions of its own though listSessions does not list them (archived in the runtime), by
 *   Claude session id; undefined while it cannot say yet (its archive not read): the node then keeps the ones it was
 *   told last. Sent with every list once named, an empty array too (runtime.sessions' unlisted_transcripts): the node
 *   keeps listing them as sessions not running. Only a runtime that runs Claude Code's command line itself needs it:
 *   its transcripts read like a script's one-shot `claude -p` runs, which the node leaves out.
 * @property {(params: object) => Promise<object>} items - one session.items page (before_seq / turns / limit /
 *   after_seq / from_seq + through_seq → items, has_more, history, to_seq, from_seq, more_after, more).
 * @property {(sessionId: string) => Promise<number | {to_seq: number, history?: string}>} [cursor] - the session's
 *   current to_seq (where a watch from now starts), with its history so that a rewrite of as many entries is told
 *   apart; default: the to_seq and history of a one-turn page.
 * @property {(params: object) => Promise<object>} [image] - session.image → {mime, data}.
 * @property {(params: object) => Promise<object>} [item] - session.item → the whole item.
 * @property {(params: {session_id: string, text: string, images?: object[], client_msg_id?: string}) => Promise<void>} [send]
 * @property {(params: {session_id: string}) => Promise<void>} [interrupt]
 * @property {(params: {cwd: string, prompt?: string}) => Promise<{session: object}>} [start]
 * @property {(params: {session_id: string, title: string}) => Promise<void>} [rename]
 * @property {(params: {session_id: string}) => Promise<void>} [close]
 * @property {(params: {session_id: string, prompt: string, occurrence: number, prompts_after?: number, restore: string}) => Promise<object>} [rewind] -
 *   native conversation rewind, with target validation and rewritten history published through append.
 * @property {(params: {session_id: string}) => Promise<void>} [archive] - the runtime's own reversible archive of an
 *   idle session, without stopping or closing anything (caps.archive: only with unarchive too). The session the user
 *   archives in Persona is archived here as well; already archived answers as done.
 * @property {(params: {session_id: string}) => Promise<void>} [unarchive] - restores what archive archived (already
 *   restored answers as done).
 * @property {(params: {launcher: string, cwd: string, prompt: string}) => Promise<object>} [check] -
 *   launcher availability in the runtime's authentication context (caps.check), returning the launcher-check shape.
 * @property {(params: {launcher?: string, refresh?: boolean}) => Promise<{agent: string, models: object[]}>} [models] -
 *   live native model discovery (caps.models), without inference. Rejections reach the picker.
 * @property {(params: {session_id: string, permission_mode?: string, effort?: string, model?: string}) => Promise<void>} [modes] - the
 *   phone's permission mode / effort for a session (caps.modes; model requires options.modelSwitch); values are Persona's: default / acceptEdits / plan /
 *   auto / bypassPermissions, low … max.
 * @property {(params: {session_id: string}) => Promise<void>} [seen] - the user saw the session in Persona (caps.seen): a
 *   runtime that keeps an unread mark of its own (Paseo's requiresAttention) clears it, so the session is not unread
 *   there too. The node sends it only for a session the runtime lists as done (unread).
 * @property {(params: {cwd: string, workspace_id?: string, branch?: string, create_branch?: boolean, base?: string,
 *   name?: string, key?: string}) => Promise<{workspace: object}>} [createWorkspace] - a worktree of the repository cwd is
 *   in, made by the runtime as a workspace of its own (caps.workspaces, with prepareWorkspace): branch checked out as it
 *   is (create_branch false), or made from base, in the folder name (a-z, 0-9 and single hyphens, at most 50) under
 *   prepareWorkspace's; no branch: the runtime names the branch and the folder. Resolves to the new workspace's row
 *   (rt.workspacesChanged's shape) with the folder and branch it actually has.
 * @property {(params: {cwd: string, repo_root: string}) => Promise<{checkouts: string}>} [prepareWorkspace] - the
 *   folder createWorkspace puts worktrees of that repository in (repo_root: its main checkout), for the dialog to show;
 *   caps.workspaces takes both.
 * @property {(params: {workspace_id?: string, space_id?: string, title: string}) => Promise<{workspace?: object,
 *   space_name?: string}>} [renameWorkspace] - with caps.workspaces: a workspace's title (workspace_id; resolves to its
 *   row as it is now), or the name of the space its sessions are grouped in (space_id; resolves to the name the space
 *   shows now). Neither renames a branch, a folder or a session.
 * @property {(params: {workspace_id: string}) => Promise<{archived_at?: string}>} [archiveWorkspace] - with
 *   caps.workspaces: the workspace leaves the runtime's list, its sessions archived with it, and a worktree the runtime
 *   made is removed from the disk (its branch stays). The node has checked what the user confirmed first.
 * @property {() => boolean} [hasLocalClient] - the runtime's own UI is open (the policy gives it first turn).
 * @property {(sessionId: string, watching: boolean, o?: { transcript: boolean }) => void} [watchChanged] - the phone
 *   started (or stopped) watching a session: a runtime that follows a session only while it is watched (Paseo's
 *   timeline subscription) starts and ends that here. transcript: the node reads its items (only live text from here).

 *   per provider, each with the agent it starts and its models); rt.launchersChanged replaces them. resume: start
 *   takes {resume: <Claude session id>} — taking a session it does not have over, under that id (caps.resume; the
 *   machine's engine continuing a session not running anywhere). keepAlways: the runtime keeps no "always allow" rule
 *   itself; a permission card with an always_label then gets the hub's "Always allow in this session" for that session and tool
 *   (caps.keep_always, #3974). A runtime whose always is a rule of its own (narrower than the tool) leaves it off.
 *   readonly: start with permission_mode "plan" runs in a read-only mode from the first prompt or throws
 *   RpcError(…, 'readonly_unsupported'), never falling back to a writable agent (caps.readonly; without it the node
 *   refuses such starts itself).
 *   assistant: its launcher may run the Persona assistant (caps.assistant; docs/integrations/runtimes.md "Assistant"). requires: node
 *   features (runtime.hello's features) this runtime cannot do without; on a node lacking one it does not stay
 *   connected, and tries again once the node restarts (its socket file is replaced) or after 10 minutes. onHub: called
 *   after every hello and whenever the node's hub comes or goes (a runtime fetching the hub's tools does it then).
 *   listen: be a daemon (docs/integrations/daemons.md) — the node dials this runtime's WebSocket endpoint instead of the runtime
 *   dialing runtime.sock. With a port ({port, host, path, token}; port 0 picks one) start() serves the endpoint
 *   itself (host 127.0.0.1 and path /persona/runtime by default); without one ({token}, or `true` with
 *   options.token) the runtime's own HTTP server hands upgrades to rt.accept(). The token is what the node's
 *   daemons.json gives for this daemon (a function: read at every connection).
 *   package / onUpdate: the code this runtime runs, for a node that keeps it up to date (docs/integrations/runtimes.md "Auto-update";
 *   the loader, loader.js, passes both): hello says the package, and when the node carries another one its reply
 *   offers it — onUpdate gets the offer, rt.fetchPackage gets the files. instance: this process's identity on the node
 *   (runtime.hello's instance; default a new one per createRuntime). A runtime that replaces itself in the same process
