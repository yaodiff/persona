// Decisions the owner can answer (#3804, docs/assistant/todos.md "Decisions the owner can answer"). A supervised task
// reviewed needs_user reaches the owner only as a decision: it names why only they can decide (why_owner), what is to
// be decided in one sentence, the option recommended, two to four options with what each leads to, and what waiting
// costs; anything less is refused and the supervisor decides, sends the work back or closes it. The hub, not the
// model, adds where the task came from and where it stands. A decision that can be undone takes its recommendation
// after decisionDefaultAfter unless the review set its own deadline (decision_deadline.go); one that cannot, or that
// other people will see, is never taken and is raised again once a day. One older than decisionRecheckAfter goes back
// to its supervisor once to confirm its facts (recheck), and a needs_user task with nothing the owner can answer goes
// back once to be restated (undecidable). Besides its options every decision takes three fixed answers that say the
