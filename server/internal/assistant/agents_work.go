// Where an agent stands in its work (docs/assistant/agent-work.md, #1686), the manager's: when a turn ends it triages it — rules
// first, then a cheap model reading the last reply — into done or blocked on a named precondition, and acts on what it
// can: "Continue" after a transient model error (with backoff and a cap), a wake when what it waits for should be over, a
// card for what the user is to decide (the answer goes back to the agent). Everything else (pushing code, deploying,
// messaging people, touching someone else's MR) is only ever a card. Each action checks, the moment before, that the
// session is still stopped on the same turn with nothing pending or queued: whatever the user did meanwhile wins.
//
// The hub carries it (assistantwire/agents.go): it says when a turn starts and ends (session.turn_started / ended)
// and when the user looked at a session (session.seen); the work states go to it in the snapshot (Snapshot.Work, put
// on the session lists), the cards among the snapshot's interactions (answered with manager.action); what the manager
// sends an agent goes through device.call session.send.

// TriageSwitches turn the triage and each of its actions on, all off until the user turns them on (Settings › Session Triage,
// settings agents.triage): the triage calls a model on every stopped turn, and a "Continue" or a wake runs a turn of the
// agent on its own model (docs/assistant/agent-work.md "Switches").
