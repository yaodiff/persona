// Tasks dispatched from an assistant conversation (docs/assistant/unified-entry.md, #930). The assistant hands the user a plan
// (task_plan); read-only plans, tasks the user asked for in so many words (#2559) and kinds the user trusts start at
// once, the rest wait for the user's "Start" on the plan card. A task is a todo (todos.go) whose origin is the conversation; its agents are ordinary agents
// (the Agents page shows them as always). What the assistant adds to the conversation — the plan card, a started
// task, an answered question, a receipt, a message sent straight to a task — is the conversation's feed, kept apart
// from Claude's transcript.

// PlanReroute records that a flexible task was moved off its requested machine because its launcher failed a health
// check, naming both machines by their display names and the health check's reason, so a card/receipt can show where
// the work was meant to run and where it landed instead (#2271).
