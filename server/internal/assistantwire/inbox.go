// The inbox (docs/assistant/inbox.md) is the manager's: the items and their state (admission, triage, events, mutes, done,
// the AI twin, translations) and the /api/v1/inbox… routes, which the hub relays like Routes. The sources are the
// extension manager's (internal/extmgr, in the manager's process): it reads them when a round is due (its poll, a
// connector's changed, InboxCollect) and hands what it read over (MethodInboxCollected); what the inbox does with a
// source (its config, a mail body, a reply, a connector's group tools…) it asks the extension manager for on AppInbox.
// Neither way goes through the hub. These are the shapes, in their own file so the other moves merge apart.

// InboxRoutes are the inbox's routes (net/http patterns), the translation's with them (it is the manager's too): the hub
// relays the apps' requests on them to the manager as http.request, like Routes. The assistant registers exactly Routes
// and these (assistant.TestRoutesAreTheWireOnes).
