// keeps, in its own settings, every manager's own entries as its last devices.state had them: each entry, the
// computer as its node last described itself, and when it was last seen. A hub that restarts shows every manager's
// machines as last reported until their manager reports them (for the minutes after a restart the warm hand-over
// shows more: devicesWarm), and a manager that stays away, its machines so: offline, with what they are and when they
// were last seen. A report counts only for the machines the hub hands its manager (hub.json's, by owner:
// ownership.go); any other id it names is refused and logged once. A move hands the entry to the new manager.
//
// hub.json is still the list the hub hands each manager; once the managers keep their own (manager.json), this is
// what the hub knows of them.
